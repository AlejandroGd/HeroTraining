  courseDescription: 'Golems are known for their hard skins, which makes physical
    attacks not very effective.

    However, their dependance on magic makes them vulnerable to dark arts and elemental
    skills, which makes this course perfect to teach your heroes about the use of
    magic and the elements and avoid physic attacks when they are not effective.'
